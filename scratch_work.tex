\section{Question 1}

$$n + d = 2011 <=> d = 2011 - n$$
$$\frac{n} {d} < \frac{1}{3}$$
$$\frac{n}{2011 - n} <  \frac{1}{3}$$
$$3n < 2011 - n$$
$$4n < 2011$$
$$n < 502.75$$
Due to the constraint that $n$ and $d$ are positive integers, the maximum value for $n$ is $502$. Therefore $d = 2011 - n = 2011 - 502 = 1509$.

\section{Question 2}

Let X be the random variable modeling the outcome of the bet, where $x_1$ is the amount by which one's money, $m$, is increased in the event that the bet is favorable, and $x_2$ is the amount by which $m$ is increased if the bet is not favorable. We know that $x_1$ and $x_2$ are complements. Therefore, the expectation of such a variable $X$ is:

$$E[X; m] = \sum_i x_iP(x_i) = 3mP(x_1) - mP(x_2) = 3mP(x_1) - m(1 - P(x_1)) = 4mP(x_1) - m$$
$$= m(4P(x_1) - 1)$$
In order for the bet to be favorable, we would need the expectation of $X$ to be positive, i.e.,:

$$E[X; m] = m(4P(x_1) - 1) > 0$$
$$P(x_1) > 0.25$$
Let $n$ be the number of face cards in the first 5 cards, and let $c$ be the event where the sixth card is a face card, i.e., one's money is increased. Then:

$$P(c | n = i) = \frac{12 - i}{47} $$
Therefore:
$$P(c | n = 0) = 0.255$$
$$P(c | n = 1) =  0.234$$
Thus we can see that the only way the bet is favorable (i.e., $P(x_1) = P(c | n = i) > 0.25$) is when $i = 0$. We now need to figure out the probability of such an occurrence:

$$P(n = 0) = \frac{{12 \choose 0}{40 \choose 5}}{{52 \choose 5}} = 0.25318$$

\section{Question 3}

We have the following parameters for the Poisson distribution:

$$\lambda = 100 / 5 = 20$$
$$\alpha = 0.05$$
$$n = 60$$
$$k = n\lambda = (60)(20) = 1200$$

$$CI = [\frac{1}{2}\chi^2(\frac{\alpha}{2}; 2k), \frac{1}{2}\chi^2(1 - \frac{\alpha}{2}; 2k + 2)]
= [\frac{1}{2}\chi^2(0.025; 2400), \frac{1}{2}\chi^2(0.975; 2402)]
= [1133.1, 1269.9]$$

\section{Question 4}

This is a one-sided Z-test.

$$Z^* = \frac{\hat{p} - p_0}{\sqrt{\frac{p_0(1-p_0)}{n}}}  = \frac{(\frac{26}{200} - 0.1)}{\sqrt{\frac{0.1(0.9)}{200}}} = 1.414$$
$$p = P(Z \geq Z^*) = 0.0787 > 0.05$$
Therefore we fail to reject the null hypothesis.
